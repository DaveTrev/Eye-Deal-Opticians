Eye Deal optics is a B2C business. The business sells optical and sun frames from small boutique makers from around the world.

# User-Experience-Design

## Site Goals

The site is aimed at anyone that wants to buy a bespoke frame and wants to stand out from crowd. Without signing in the user can browse the online store.
 They can also look at the site blog to see the musings from the business owner.
They can log in to see a log of the items they have bought. They can also save their details for future purchases.

## Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies, delivering small features over  sprints spaced out over  weeks.  Each issue was labelled must have, should have and could have.  The must-have features were completed first, then the should have's, then the could have's.  It was done this way to ensure a complete website is made with the nice-to-have features added if there is capacity.


# **Marketing Strategy**
The marketing strategies chosen for Eye-Deal will be SEO, Social Media Marketing and Email Marketing. Pages such as robots.txt, sitemap and privacy policy help SEO ranking.
These will all be covered in more detail below.

<br>

<br>

### **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
Keywords were identified through [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/search) and [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/home). These tools helped me identify what keywords users are searching for. To test the relevance of the keywords, each keyword was entered into [Google](https://www.google.com/) to find out the number of results and search suggestions, the most relevant were added to the keyword list. Once chosen the most suitable, these keywords were included in meta tags, titles, descriptions, headings and the content throughout the website to improve the SEO ranking.

<br>
<hr>
<br>

### **Robots.txt**
A robots.txt file was created. This improves the SEO ranking of the website by telling the search engine where not to go and which pages they can't crawl. 

<br>
<hr>
<br>

### **Sitemap**
A sitemap file with a list of important URLs is important for search engines to crawl the website and easily understand the site structure when navigating it. The sitemap was created using [XML-sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/).


<br>
<hr>
<br>

### **Social Media Marketing**<br>
Social media marketing will be integral to the success of Eye-deal. The most popular platform for social media marketing is Facebook: [Eye-Deal Optics Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/people/Eye-Deal-Optics/61554309323903/). This platform provides a link to the website, contact details and opening times. The social media accounts will be used to create interactive posts promoting new stock and encouraging sign-ups, driving traffic to the website and encouraging two-way communication.


<br>
<hr>
<br>

### **Email Marketing**<br>
Creating a mailing list for email marketing by using the 'Sign Up to Newsletter' option. Every month, the store will add new things to its inventory. First access to these products will be granted to users who have subscribed to the newsletter. Email marketing will be utilised to drive visitors to the website by means of weekly newsletters with a call to action sent out via [Mail Chimp](https://mailchimp.com). 

<br>
<hr>
<br>

### **Privacy Policy**
The [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.termly.io/) was employed to write Eye-Deals privacy policy. This should be prominently displayed on the website as it explains to visitors how and why we gather their personal data. Search engine algorithms will consider the website reliable and give it priority over websites without one, as a matter of SEO and marketing strategy.

CHANGE FONT FROM LATO to custom!
Merriweather chosen
"Meriweather is quite popular and one of the widely used brand fonts for websites. Especially for the e-commerce ones. Indeed, it is pleasant to look at because of its condensed letterforms. Also, it is ideal for font pairings. If you wish to have a high-end brand image, then Merriweather is the best fonts style for it!"

Bugs
Search bar returning products, not exactly correct?
removing male / female dropdown toggle as filtering not working on gender? return to fix, below code removed from header "for him" "for her"
        <li class="nav-item dropdown">
            <a class="logo-font font-weight-bold nav-link text-black mr-5" href="#" id="mens-link" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
                For Him
            </a>
            <div class="dropdown-menu border-0" aria-labelledby="mens-link">
                <a href="{% url 'products' %}?category=Glasses&gender=Male" class="dropdown-item">Glasses</a>
                <a href="{% url 'products' %}?category=Male,Sunglasses" class="dropdown-item">Sunglasses</a>
                <a href="{% url 'products' %}?category=Male,Glasses,Sunglasses" class="dropdown-item">All Mens Frames</a>
            </div>
        </li>

I noticed you have a field for gender but also there is category class. (with thanks to Dayana for this one)
If gender is part of your product model then you will need to refine your products by gender instead of category. 
You could also create a separate class gender like a subcategory connected to your product and filter that way too


Bug - update number not reflecting in shopping bag, followed ado, number not reflecting items. return to fix!
Roman From Ci Tutor Team helped me spot this one!
value="{{ item.quantity }}" tou your increment/decrement form in bag.html

https://elfsight.com/blog/how-to-create-recent-sales-notification-popup/#:~:text=The%20Recent%20Sales%20Notification%20popup,many%20e%2Dcommerce%20businesses%20nowadays.

Popup? 

Bug - allauth login page not loading, after much searching and with help from the CI tutor support, clearing the cookies / cache helped to display the login page


env file setup - as per CI Tutor Roman
For setting env vars locally, we recommend setting them like this:
Create a file named env.py in the root directory of your project. This is the file you will use to define your environment variables.
If you don't have one already, create a file named .gitignore  in the root directory of your project.
 Next we need to stop git from pushing this file to github, and so keep your environment variables secret. To do this, open your .gitignore  file add the following text to it: env.py 
At the top of your env.py  file, you need to import os so that you can set the environment variables in the operating system. Once you have added the line “import os” underneath you can assign your environment variables using the following syntax: 
os.environ["Variable Name Here"] = "Value of Variable Goes Here" 
Example: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "ohsosecret" 
Then the following code imports this new env.py file where you need to use your environment variables. For example your app.py file for flask project or settings.py file for Django project. Add this under your other imports at the top of the file. 
import os
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
  import env 
The if statement here is so that the env.py file is only pulled when working on your code in your workspace, not when it is deployed on heroku. For deployment you can set your environment variables in the heroku dashboard in settings > config vars.
Now that your environment variables have been set in your env.py file, and the file has been imported into your project, you can use them as needed using the following syntax: 
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
Make sure you save all your files before testing if it works.

bug - on mobile contact us success page hidden by navbar, return to fix


nologo.png aws issue with thats to Dayana
It may not make a difference but here is a thought, move these 4 lines above the If AWS statement.
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),)
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
I wonder, is it checking for the if statement and then overriding the settings on the next line if that makes sense


bug html validation, summernote causing errors in add and edit journaleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
	Multiple Errors all from summernote widget for blog content field



migration
Hi David, the only data that you really need to be concerned about is your products, Users should not be transferred over as this can lead to problems (I know this from debugging so many of these issues)

you can follow these steps for the app that you want to transfer the data over, if you have more than 1 app that you want to transfer over, then do them separately:

​﻿1. Make sure you are connected to the local Sqlite3 database in Gitpod.


​﻿2. Make a backup of the app's data that you want. For the example, we will use the "product" app.
﻿- (type this command, do not copy and paste):
﻿- python3 manage.py dumpdata products > products.json
​
​﻿3. Make sure you are connected to the online Postgres database in Heroku.


​﻿﻿4. Transfer the backup json file data that you just created.
﻿- (type this command, do not copy and paste):
﻿- python3 manage.py loaddata products.json
​﻿﻿5. Repeat for any other apps you wish to transfer.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank:

- As always, many many thanks to my better half Jenny and my kids Rose and Ollie for their ongoing patience while I worked on this project and disappeared for weeks. Jenny has endured a very absent partner over the last 52 weeks, while also becoming my rubber duckie for problem solving, this will never be forgotten.
- To my faithful dog Ziggy, who helps me get out the door on many a walk, decompressing and figuring problems out while away from the screen.
-  I would like to thank my mentor [Jubril Akolade](https://github.com/Jubrillionaire) whos support and patience helped guide me through this project.
- My fellow students in no particular order [Paul Gleeson](https://github.com/Shaga-Matula), [Indrek Mannik](https://github.com/Inc21), 
[Lornavav](https://github.com/Lornavav), [Darragh](https://github.com/d-lynch95), [Dayana](https://github.com/Dayana-N) (Not forgetting Brendan too) 
 for all the advice, support and picking apart the puzzles that coding presents. 
- Cohort facilitator Paul Thomas O'Riordan, for their general advice and support through out this course. 
- The invaluable Slack community and tutors at tutor support, really helping in times of need.
