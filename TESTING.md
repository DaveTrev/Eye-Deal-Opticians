# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

I've run a lot of tests throughout the project's development to make sure the website functions properly. All of the site's testing are documented in this area.

## Code Validation

I have validated all of my code using the recommended tools for each language.

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.
